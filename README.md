# University Project Software Engineering
This is a group project completed by myself as a full-stack developer and my two colleagues. One colleague focused on backend development, while the other worked on UI/UX. Please note that this is only a portion of the application, as the complete project is the private property of the university. The showcased portion is also outdated.

Additionally, we have provided documentation for this project as the primary objective was to create a real-world software application with thorough documentation. We followed the Rational Unified Process (RUP) model for software engineering.

The application, called "Flower Power," aims to connect flower shops with their customers. It enables users to easily find specific types of flowers or flower arrangements for special events. Similar to Glovo, our application does not provide courier services but offers everything else. Please note that Flower Power is designed exclusively for the Serbian market and is not an online platform.
# Features
- Secure, HTTP-only authentication with two types of profiles: flower and user. Admin profiles are manually created by developers.
- Validation of GDP and other legal requirements necessary for shop operations.
- Suspension system for dealing with problematic users and underperforming shops.
- Review system for users to share their experiences and feedback.
- Notification system to keep users updated on important events or offers.
- Messaging system for communication between users and flower shops.
- Special offer system to promote products/arrangements not regularly displayed.
- Credit card payment integration for convenient transactions.
- Filters to help users narrow down their search.
- Smart shopping cart for an enhanced shopping experience.
Please note that this description is based on the outdated version of the project and represents only a partial implementation.
